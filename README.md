A set of OpsWorks / Berkshelf compliant chef recipes.
I have found these to be useful for various projects, and so I'm making them available to others as I add to the list.

opsworks-cairo     - Various dependencies and libraries for using the Cairo image processing library
opsworks-mongodb   - Mongo DB
opsworks-ruby-sass - Ruby/SASS
